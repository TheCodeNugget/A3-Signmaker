Download the latest version and unpack and run with terminal of your choice.

```console
.\A3-Signmaker.exe .\terrainname.hpp 1
```
Where:

`.\terrainname.hpp` is the header file that Terrain Builder creates when exporting a WRP

### :warning: Important
Program uses the the name of `.hpp` file to name the files it generates, TB exports this file with the name of your terrain.

The program will create signs for keypoints with types: `NameCityCapital`, `NameCity` & `nameVillage`

`1` is the selection for the type of sign you'd like created.

### Sign Types
Handle  | Type    
--------|--------------
1       | Altis Sign
2       | Livonia Sign
3       | Malden Sign
4       | Tanoa Sign
